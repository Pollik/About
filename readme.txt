The Public Service Act

The Aims of the Public Service Act are to set up the framework required in order to restore the concept of Public Service back into the conduct of elected public officials and elected representatives.

There is an increasing disconnect between the Political parties, the Government and the Electorate. This is a three way relationship.

The legitimacy of the political parties is being called into question, because none of the political parties have a mass membership. They are increasingly being controlled by small cliques , in the rump memberships. This has in turn created a number of serious problems for the political parties. The issue of funding is just one. A much more serious issue is political corruption, and the inability of the executive to stamp it out.
